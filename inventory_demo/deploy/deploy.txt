This directory contains the implementation of the Service and WebFront components for the inventory/invoice demo program

 A. Java server implementation -
	InventoryService-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war - an executable java jar file packaged as a .war (web archive)
	  This is necessary for the embedded tomcat web server within the jar file that provides the web services
	  for this Java implementation. It simply needs to be run on the intended server machine as a Java jar file
	  as follows:

		java -jar ./InventoryService-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war

		(assuming the file is in the current working directory)
		the default configuration serves the REST APIs on port 8080 of the serving host

		the api roots for the data currently implemented are

		contacts - /api/inventory/contact
		customers - /api/inventory/customer
		vendors - /api/inventory/vendors

		data is served and received in JSON format

		presently the service allows cross-origin request from the Angular CLI development server at
		port 4200 on the serving machine ( or localhost as is typical for development ) allowing the 
		Angular client to be run on the same maching as the serving service.

		the service is configured to open MySQL database on the localhost at default port 3306 and 
		it is assumed that there is root user there with password 'root' (i.e. root@localhost:3306 )

B. Angular2 / Typescript client implementation allowing client access to the data services in web page running in standard browser.
	these files will need to be served from a static web page service and will execute as JavaScript in the users browser.

	presently copied into the deploy directory - ( this one ) in subdirectory ./dist/inventory-web-front
